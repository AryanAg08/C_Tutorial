C programming tutorials
===========
> [You can view my videos on these examples on youtube](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJ7II9mlYqWjIsuhVdbqhiigU2bKYtrmE)

This is merely an educational means to teach myself and others C programming.  I invite anyone to modify it and send me suggestions.  If your new to C, I suggest reading the C_programming_readings folder and looking at the example folders 
to get started and then trying the practice problems when ready.

###Compiling In C using GCC


######Note:  All of these programs have a main method to be run separately so please to make sure you compile and run the example on its own if you are using gcc you can use:

```
gcc -o  BitChange BitChange.c  # you want: gcc -o <executable name> <file name.c> <file2.c> ...
#Note you do not need <> in the terminal or put in .h files, that is linked for you.
```

#####Then you can run it from your terminal in the directory of the executable with ./{executable name}
